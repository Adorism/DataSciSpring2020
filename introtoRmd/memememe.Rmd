## Diamonds

Get libraries, load data, and look at it.
```{r setup}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
data("diamonds")
str(diamonds)
```

From R4DS, Chapter 27.
Taking the diamonds dataset, "Add a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, colour, and clarity. Assume you’re writing a report for someone who doesn’t know R, and instead of setting echo = FALSE on each chunk, set a global option."

## Begin with looking only at little diamonds
```{r}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
