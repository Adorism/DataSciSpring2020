# Lab

## The first lab will be to discuss what's in the lab

There are several models or approaches. We'll discuss these today and decide how to move forward. For all of these, a reproducible write-up is essential.

## The project/activity approach

This includes projects ranging in scope, ambition, and potential, from the weekly or bi-weekly activity to the term-long project

#### Lab as a series of activities

This is the most traditional approach. Activities are typically smaller in scope than "projects." These particular activities, drawn from Salgarnik's *Bit by Bit,* are focused on computational social science.

#### Lab as a series of projects

Example: Bravo's (Maryland) Introduction to Data Science

Four projects including http://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/projects/Project2/, http://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/projects/Project4/.

#### Lab as building to a single, publishable data project

At Harvard, students develop "a month-long data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results." http://datasciencelabs.github.io/2016/pages/projects.html

At UCSB, there is a working group which produces student projects and publishes them on the https://www.inertia7.com platform

**Any such project would, presumably, be presented at the Research Symposium**

A more modest, but somewhat cool thing to consider, would be to modify the rBookdown package to create a template for a thesis that would be acceptable here at the Honors College.

## The skills approach

A second approach would be for us to build on skills not considered, or considered only briefly, in the main class.  Examples could include study of Git and GitHub for version control, Jupyter notebooks (roughly, Python:Jupyter as R markdown:R), or SQL and database management.

Within R, students could collectively learn to use other packages (eg., leaflet, igraph) or, conceivably, write their own.

Students might also be interested in developing better visualizations, using other tools including Tableau.

**I expect that a critical component of these skills would be writing documentation that would be accessible to me and to students who are taking the lecture but not the lab.**

## The 'my data' approach

A third approach would be to use the tools of data science to examine data that you are examining in someone's lab here at the WHC. This could include data that you will analyze for your thesis if those data are being examined by a group of students in the class.

Learning something new and teaching it to me

Additional r packages for mapping (leaflet, e.g., http://www.hcbravo.org/IntroDataSci/projects/Project4/

## The 'other data' approach

Here, we can examine datasets such as those discussed in Seth Stephens-Davidowitz' book - http://sethsd.com/research/.  I think that we should do this either next week or the week after, depending on when students can get the book.

There are a zillion other data sources, too.

## Competitions and challenges

As @hicks2017guide has argued, competitions or challenges are a major feature of contemporary data science, but are underrepresented in teaching in the area. One approach for us would be to examine [Kaggle datasets](https://inclass.kaggle.com/datasets), such as the [Global Terrorism Database](https://inclass.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd)

The classic Kaggle is the [Netflix prize](https://gist.github.com/loretoparisi/be046926960797a15fea).

## All or some of the above

We can combine some or all of these, depending on the goals of the class.  That's what we will begin to examine today.

#### Be patient. Remeber that trying can be trying
