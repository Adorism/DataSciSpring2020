*(This is the output of the combined dataSciRefs.bib and packages.bib files, which I manage using the open-source bibliographic tool [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/). Most of the individual references were generated by using Google Scholar and an associated [plug-in](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn?hl=en) for the Chrome browser).*
