This site (https://kevinlanning.github.io/introDataScience/) hosts course materials for the Wilkes Honors College (WHC) *Intro to Data Science* course in Spring 2018, taught by Professors Kevin Lanning and Warren McGovern, and the lab *Intro to Data Science with R* taught by Dr. Lanning. It is a work in progress, and will be continuously revised throughout the term.

The files which were used to generate this site reside on https://github.com/kevinlanning/introDataScience. It was created using [this very helpful post by Aleszu Bajak](http://www.storybench.org/convert-google-doc-rmarkdown-publish-github-pages/).
